# Roots-of-non-linear-equation-using-Newton-Raphson
The implementation for solving a non-linear equation using Newton-Raphson method in Matlab and Verilog is attached. The implementation in Verilog includes 32-bit Floating Point Precision


The floating point ALU was referred from https://github.com/CruzeBurada/Floating-Point-ALU-in-Verilog for Verilog implementation

The Example 2 in the given link was implemented http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e176/lectures/NM/node21.html
